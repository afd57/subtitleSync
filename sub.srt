<i>The age and size of the cosmos</i>

3
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:40,150
<i>are written in light.</i>

4
00:01:40,185 --> 00:01:45,022
<i>The nature of beauty and</i>
<i>the substance of the stars,</i>

5
00:01:45,056 --> 00:01:48,425
<i>the laws of space and time...</i>

6
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,428
<i>they were there all along,</i>

7
00:01:51,463 --> 00:01:53,464
<i>but we never saw them...</i>

8
00:01:53,498 --> 00:01:57,334
<i>until we devised</i>
<i>a more powerful way of seeing.</i>

9
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:01,038
<i>The story of this awakening</i>
<i>has many beginnings</i>

10
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:03,207
<i>and no ending.</i>

11
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:06,443
<i>Its heroes come from many times</i>
<i>and places--</i>

12
00:02:06,478 --> 00:02:09,280
<i>an Ancient Chinese philosopher,</i>

13
00:02:09,314 --> 00:02:12,983
<i>a wizard who amazed the caliphs</i>
<i>of 11th-century Iraq,</i>

14
00:02:13,018 --> 00:02:17,888
<i>a poor German orphan enslaved</i>
<i>to a harsh master.</i>

15
00:02:17,922 --> 00:02:20,357
<i>Each one brought us</i>
<i>a little closer</i>

16
00:02:20,392 --> 00:02:24,595
<i>to unlocking the secrets</i>
<i>hidden in light.</i>

17
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:30,668
<i>Most of their names</i>
<i>are forever lost to us,</i>

18
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:35,205
<i>but somewhere, long ago,</i>
<i>someone glanced up</i>

19
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:39,610
<i>to see light perform</i>
<i>one of its magic tricks.</i>

20
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:01,932
<i>Who knows?</i>

21
00:03:01,967 --> 00:03:03,734
<i>Maybe that quirk of light</i>

22
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:05,903
<i>inspired the very first artist.</i>

23
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:21,185
<i>Where did all this come from?</i>

24
00:03:21,219 --> 00:03:24,788
How did we evolve
from small wandering bands

25
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:26,957
of hunters and gatherers living
beneath the stars

26
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:30,761
to become the builders
of a global civilization?

27
00:03:30,795 --> 00:03:34,231
How did we get from there
to here?

28
00:03:34,265 --> 00:03:36,066
There's no one answer.

29
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,769
Climate change,
the domestication of fire,

30
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:43,307
<i>the invention of tools,</i>
<i>language, agriculture</i>

31
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:46,610
<i>all played a role.</i>

32
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,279
<i>Maybe there was</i>
<i>something else, too.</i>

33
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:52,449
<i>In China,</i>
<i>more than 2,000 years ago,</i>

34
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:55,653
<i>a philosopher named Mo Tze</i>
<i>is said to have observed</i>

35
00:03:55,687 --> 00:03:58,055
<i>that light could be made</i>
<i>to paint a picture</i>

36
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:00,324
<i>inside a locked treasure room.</i>

37
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:05,796
<i>This was the description</i>
<i>of the first camera...</i>

38
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:07,931
<i>the camera obscura,</i>

39
00:04:07,966 --> 00:04:10,334
<i>the prototype of all</i>
<i>image-forming cameras,</i>

40
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,637
<i>including the one that's</i>
<i>bringing you this picture.</i>

41
00:04:13,672 --> 00:04:16,273
<i>Taking advantage of this funny</i>
<i>thing that light does</i>

42
00:04:16,308 --> 00:04:21,278
<i>resulted in what could be</i>
<i>called the first movie.</i>

43
00:04:21,313 --> 00:04:27,084
<i>Mo Tze, master of light, worked</i>
<i>against all forms of darkness.</i>

44
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:28,852
<i>A military genius</i>

45
00:04:28,887 --> 00:04:32,022
<i>who only used his talents</i>
<i>to prevent violence,</i>

46
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:34,024
<i>he was legendary for traveling</i>

47
00:04:34,059 --> 00:04:36,160
<i>among the kingdoms</i>
<i>of the warring states,</i>

48
00:04:36,194 --> 00:04:37,928
<i>employing ingenious strategies</i>

49
00:04:37,963 --> 00:04:39,997
<i>to talk kings out</i>
<i>of going to war.</i>

50
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:43,600
<i>He was one of the first</i>
<i>to dream of universal love</i>

51
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:46,704
<i>and an end to poverty</i>
<i>and other forms of inequality;</i>

52
00:04:46,738 --> 00:04:50,674
<i>of government for the people...</i>

53
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,143
<i>and to argue against</i>
<i>blind obedience</i>

54
00:04:53,178 --> 00:04:54,545
<i>to ritual and authority.</i>

55
00:04:54,579 --> 00:04:56,146
<i>In his writings, you can find</i>

56
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:59,883
<i>early stirrings</i>
<i>of the scientific approach.</i>

57
00:04:59,918 --> 00:05:02,853
<i>By Mo Tze's time, the Chinese</i>
<i>had already been recording</i>

58
00:05:02,887 --> 00:05:06,223
<i>their thoughts in books</i>
<i>for at least a thousand years.</i>

59
00:05:06,257 --> 00:05:09,193
<i>Still, our knowledge of him</i>
<i>is only fragmentary.</i>

60
00:05:09,227 --> 00:05:11,662
<i>It consists largely</i>
<i>of the collection of essays</i>

61
00:05:11,696 --> 00:05:13,364
<i>attributed to him</i>
<i>and his disciples.</i>

62
00:05:13,398 --> 00:05:16,533
<i>In one of them,</i>
<i>entitled "Against Fate,"</i>

63
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:19,670
<i>a three-pronged test</i>
<i>for every doctrine is proposed.</i>

64
00:05:19,704 --> 00:05:22,206
<i>Question its basis--</i>

65
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,907
<i>ask if it can be verified</i>

66
00:05:23,942 --> 00:05:26,477
<i>by the sights and senses</i>
<i>of common people--</i>

67
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:28,245
<i>ask how it is to be applied</i>

68
00:05:28,279 --> 00:05:30,614
<i>and if it will benefit</i>
<i>the greatest number.</i>

69
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:37,521
<i>Mo Tze was extremely popular,</i>

70
00:05:37,555 --> 00:05:39,857
<i>but a few hundred years</i>
<i>after his death,</i>

71
00:05:39,891 --> 00:05:42,826
<i>Qin Shi Huang,</i>
<i>the first emperor,</i>

72
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:45,896
<i>and unifier of China,</i>
<i>took power.</i>

73
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,499
<i>He took a continent</i>
<i>and turned it into a nation</i>

74
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:51,935
<i>that now bears his name... China.</i>

75
00:05:54,973 --> 00:05:59,443
<i>Most of us know Emperor Qin</i>
<i>for the army of 7,000</i>

76
00:05:59,477 --> 00:06:02,780
<i>terra cotta warriors</i>
<i>that guard his tomb.</i>

77
00:06:04,649 --> 00:06:07,584
In Emperor Qin's drive

78
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,220
to consolidate
his far-flung empire,

79
00:06:10,255 --> 00:06:11,922
he took drastic measures

80
00:06:11,957 --> 00:06:14,425
to standardize everything
within it.

81
00:06:14,459 --> 00:06:17,394
This included mandating
a single coinage,

82
00:06:17,429 --> 00:06:19,964
making uniform all weights
and measures,

83
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:23,801
the widths of carts and roads,
as well as the precise way

84
00:06:23,835 --> 00:06:26,036
the Chinese language was
to be written,

85
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:31,108
including what you were
allowed to write and think.

86
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,911
Emperor Qin's philosophy--
the only one permitted--

87
00:06:33,945 --> 00:06:35,546
was called "legalism,"

88
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,148
which is just what
it sounded like,

89
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:41,585
do as the law says... or else.

90
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,654
<i>It's a philosophy that's</i>
<i>not highly conducive</i>

91
00:06:44,689 --> 00:06:46,690
<i>to questioning authority.</i>

92
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:54,565
...that all the books of
the hundred schools of thought

93
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:56,233
shall be be burned,

94
00:06:56,267 --> 00:06:59,670
that anyone who uses history
to criticize the present

95
00:06:59,704 --> 00:07:01,972
shall have his family executed.

96
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:06,110
<i>The works of</i>
<i>MoTze and Confucius</i>

97
00:07:06,144 --> 00:07:08,345
<i>and other philosophers</i>
<i>were destroyed</i>

98
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:10,347
<i>in the world's first</i>
<i>book burning.</i>

99
00:07:10,382 --> 00:07:12,950
<i>Hundreds of scholars</i>
<i>bravely resisted</i>

100
00:07:12,984 --> 00:07:15,686
<i>by trying to preserve</i>
<i>the forbidden books.</i>

101
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,322
<i>They were buried alive</i>
<i>in the capitol.</i>

102
00:07:20,058 --> 00:07:23,861
Science needs the light
of free expression to flourish.

103
00:07:23,895 --> 00:07:27,264
It depends on the fearless
questioning of authority,

104
00:07:27,299 --> 00:07:29,867
the open exchange of ideas.

105
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:33,604
Sparks of curiosity
in the writings of Mo Tze

106
00:07:33,638 --> 00:07:37,374
and his disciples were
effectively stomped out.

107
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:42,012
It would be another thousand
years before the next movie.

108
00:07:43,915 --> 00:07:46,150
<i>Luckily, our Ship</i>
<i>of the Imagination</i>

109
00:07:46,184 --> 00:07:50,187
<i>can take us anywhere</i>
<i>in space... and time.</i>

110
00:07:57,854 --> 00:08:00,522
<i>The ancient Chinese</i>
<i>and Greeks observed</i>

111
00:08:00,557 --> 00:08:02,191
that light could be made

112
00:08:02,225 --> 00:08:05,027
to do wonderful things--
but no one asked that question

113
00:08:05,061 --> 00:08:10,332
favored by small children
and geniuses alike. Why?

114
00:08:10,367 --> 00:08:13,402
Until a thousand years ago...

115
00:08:18,508 --> 00:08:20,843
<i>In the city of Basra, Iraq,</i>

116
00:08:20,877 --> 00:08:22,845
<i>there lived</i>
<i>another master of light.</i>

117
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:28,217
<i>Ibn al-Hazen had a passionate</i>
<i>desire to understand nature.</i>

118
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:30,352
<i>He questioned everything,</i>

119
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:34,323
<i>especially those things that</i>
<i>everyone else took for granted.</i>

120
00:08:36,259 --> 00:08:39,461
<i>"How do we see?" he asked.</i>

121
00:08:39,496 --> 00:08:41,864
<i>Some of the great authorities</i>
<i>who came before him</i>

122
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:45,467
<i>had taught that rays come out</i>
<i>of our eyes and travel</i>

123
00:08:45,502 --> 00:08:49,838
<i>to the objects we see</i>
<i>before returning to our eyes.</i>

124
00:08:49,873 --> 00:08:53,742
<i>But al-Hazen reasoned that</i>
<i>the stars were too far distant</i>

125
00:08:53,777 --> 00:08:56,345
<i>for something in our eyes</i>
<i>to travel all the way to them</i>

126
00:08:56,379 --> 00:08:59,014
<i>and back in the blink</i>
<i>of an eye.</i>

127
00:08:59,049 --> 00:09:02,685
<i>Excellent reasoning,</i>
<i>but al-Hazen didn't stop there.</i>

128
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,989
<i>He searched for ways to compel</i>
<i>nature to divulge her secrets.</i>

129
00:09:07,023 --> 00:09:10,325
<i>His culture was open</i>
<i>to new ideas and questioning.</i>

130
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,828
<i>It was the golden age</i>
<i>of science</i>

131
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:15,064
<i>in the Islamic world.</i>

132
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:18,534
<i>One that stretched from Cordoba</i>
<i>in Spain</i>

133
00:09:18,568 --> 00:09:22,171
<i>all the way to Samarkand</i>
<i>in Central Asia.</i>

134
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:25,207
<i>Christian and Jewish scholars</i>
<i>were honored guests</i>

135
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:27,943
<i>at the research institutes</i>
<i>of Baghdad, Cairo,</i>

136
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:30,512
<i>and other Islamic capitols.</i>

137
00:09:30,547 --> 00:09:34,083
<i>Instead of burning books,</i>
<i>the caliphs sent emissaries</i>

138
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:37,052
<i>around the world</i>
<i>in search of books.</i>

139
00:09:50,834 --> 00:09:55,237
The caliphs lavishly funded
projects to translate, study,

140
00:09:55,271 --> 00:09:57,473
and preserve them
for future generations.

141
00:09:57,507 --> 00:10:00,442
Much of the light of Ancient
Greek science would have been

142
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:02,911
permanently extinguished
without their efforts.

143
00:10:02,946 --> 00:10:05,748
The reawakening to science
that took place in Europe,

144
00:10:05,782 --> 00:10:08,817
hundreds of years later,
was kindled by a flame

145
00:10:08,852 --> 00:10:10,085
that had been long tended

146
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,988
by Islamic scholars
and scientists.

147
00:10:13,023 --> 00:10:16,558
The Arabs also imported ideas
from India to the West,

148
00:10:16,593 --> 00:10:19,161
including the so-called
Arabic numerals

149
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:21,463
that we all use today,

150
00:10:21,498 --> 00:10:24,299
and the concept of zero...

151
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:28,437
which comes in handy

152
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:31,907
when you want to write
"billions and billions."

153
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:34,910
Arabic astronomy was
so influential,

154
00:10:34,944 --> 00:10:36,979
that we still call most
of the bright stars

155
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:38,814
by their Arabic names.

156
00:10:38,848 --> 00:10:43,919
And the "al's" in algebra,
algorithm, alchemy, and alcohol

157
00:10:43,953 --> 00:10:45,654
are just some
of the traces left

158
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:50,159
from the time when Arabic
was the language of science.

159
00:10:52,062 --> 00:10:54,797
<i>In the 11th century,</i>
<i>Ibn al-Hazen set about trying</i>

160
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:58,867
<i>to test his ideas about light</i>
<i>and how we see.</i>

161
00:10:58,902 --> 00:11:02,137
So we devised an experiment
to determine how light moves.

162
00:11:02,172 --> 00:11:04,540
We erected a tent
in full daylight

163
00:11:04,574 --> 00:11:07,676
and sealed it tightly so that
only a single ray of light

164
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,446
could pierce its inner darkness.

165
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,781
With little more than his brains

166
00:11:12,816 --> 00:11:15,050
and a straight
piece of wood-- a ruler--

167
00:11:15,085 --> 00:11:16,952
al-Hazen had accomplished
a great leap forward

168
00:11:16,986 --> 00:11:18,520
in the history of science.

169
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:22,558
He discovered that
light moves in straight lines.

170
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:29,698
But he was just getting started.

171
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:33,135
Al-Hazen figured out that
the key to forming any image--

172
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,205
whether you're talking about
an eye or camera obscura--

173
00:11:36,239 --> 00:11:38,907
is a small opening to restrict
the light that can enter

174
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,809
an otherwise darkened chamber.

175
00:11:40,844 --> 00:11:43,712
That aperture
excludes the chaos

176
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:46,415
of extraneous light rays
that surround us.

177
00:11:46,449 --> 00:11:48,083
The smaller the aperture,

178
00:11:48,118 --> 00:11:50,653
the fewer directions
that light can come from.

179
00:11:50,687 --> 00:11:52,855
And that makes
the image sharper.

180
00:11:52,889 --> 00:11:55,657
So instead of being blinded
by the light,

181
00:11:55,692 --> 00:11:58,861
we can see everything
it has to show us.

182
00:11:58,895 --> 00:12:02,197
<i>Al-Hazen made his own</i>
<i>camera obscura</i>

183
00:12:02,232 --> 00:12:04,266
<i>and dazzled the caliphs.</i>

184
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,369
<i>A camera obscura works best</i>
<i>in bright light.</i>

185
00:12:07,404 --> 00:12:11,206
<i>The stars of the night sky</i>
<i>are way too dim for this.</i>

186
00:12:11,241 --> 00:12:14,543
<i>We somehow need a bigger</i>
<i>opening to collect light,</i>

187
00:12:14,577 --> 00:12:17,012
<i>but we also need</i>
<i>to maintain focus.</i>

188
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,682
<i>A telescope collects light</i>

189
00:12:19,716 --> 00:12:22,017
<i>from any spot</i>
<i>in its field of view</i>

190
00:12:22,052 --> 00:12:25,020
<i>across the entire lens</i>
<i>or mirror,</i>

191
00:12:25,055 --> 00:12:28,757
<i>an opening much larger</i>
<i>than the camera obscura hole.</i>

192
00:12:28,792 --> 00:12:32,695
<i>This is one</i>
<i>of the first telescopes...</i>

193
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:36,799
<i>the one that Galileo looked</i>
<i>through in 1609.</i>

194
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:41,070
<i>With it, he pulled aside</i>
<i>the heavy curtain of night</i>

195
00:12:41,104 --> 00:12:44,006
<i>and began to discover</i>
<i>the cosmos.</i>

196
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,620
<i>The lens made it possible</i>

197
00:12:58,655 --> 00:13:01,724
<i>for a telescope to have a much</i>
<i>larger light-collecting area</i>

198
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:04,059
<i>than our eyes have.</i>

199
00:13:04,094 --> 00:13:07,496
<i>Big buckets catch more rain</i>
<i>than small ones.</i>

200
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:10,432
<i>Modern telescopes have larger</i>
<i>collecting areas,</i>

201
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:12,134
<i>highly sensitive detectors,</i>

202
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:15,070
<i>and they track the same object</i>
<i>for hours at a time</i>

203
00:13:15,105 --> 00:13:18,440
<i>to accumulate as much</i>
<i>of its light as possible.</i>

204
00:13:18,475 --> 00:13:21,243
<i>Space-based telescopes</i>
<i>such as the Hubble,</i>

205
00:13:21,277 --> 00:13:23,112
<i>have captured light</i>
<i>from the most distant</i>

206
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:24,780
<i>and ancient galaxies,</i>

207
00:13:24,814 --> 00:13:27,983
<i>giving us vastly clearer</i>
<i>pictures of the cosmos.</i>

208
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:33,322
Al-Hazen discovered how images
are formed by light,

209
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:35,691
but that was far
from his greatest achievement.

210
00:13:35,725 --> 00:13:38,427
Ibn al-Hazen was the first
person ever

211
00:13:38,461 --> 00:13:41,130
to set down
the rules of science.

212
00:13:41,164 --> 00:13:43,665
He created
an error-correcting mechanism,

213
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:46,168
a systematic and relentless way

214
00:13:46,202 --> 00:13:48,837
to sift out misconceptions
in our thinking.

215
00:13:48,872 --> 00:13:53,842
Finding truth is difficult...

216
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:56,845
and the road to it is rough.

217
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,148
As seekers after truth,

218
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:02,284
you will be wise to withhold
judgment and not simply put

219
00:14:02,318 --> 00:14:05,187
your trust in the writings
of the ancients.

220
00:14:05,221 --> 00:14:09,024
You must question and critically
examine those writings

221
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:11,560
from every side.

222
00:14:11,594 --> 00:14:14,830
You must submit only
to argument and experiment

223
00:14:14,864 --> 00:14:18,233
and not to the sayings
of any person.

224
00:14:18,268 --> 00:14:20,803
For every human being
is vulnerable

225
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:23,505
to all kinds of imperfection.

226
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,974
As seekers after truth,

227
00:14:26,009 --> 00:14:28,343
we must also suspect
and question

228
00:14:28,378 --> 00:14:31,980
our own ideas as we perform
our investigations,

229
00:14:32,015 --> 00:14:36,919
to avoid falling into prejudice
or careless thinking.

230
00:14:36,953 --> 00:14:42,191
Take this course, and truth
will be revealed to you.

231
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:02,244
<i>This is the method of science.</i>

232
00:15:02,278 --> 00:15:05,080
<i>So powerful that it's carried</i>
<i>our robotic emissaries</i>

233
00:15:05,115 --> 00:15:08,550
<i>to the edge of</i>
<i>the solar system and beyond.</i>

234
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,588
<i>It has doubled our lifespan,</i>

235
00:15:12,622 --> 00:15:14,389
<i>made the lost worlds</i>
<i>of the past</i>

236
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:16,425
come alive.

237
00:15:17,827 --> 00:15:20,062
Science has enabled us
to predict events

238
00:15:20,096 --> 00:15:22,564
in the distant future...

239
00:15:22,599 --> 00:15:26,068
and to communicate with each
other at the speed of light,

240
00:15:26,102 --> 00:15:28,704
as I am with you,
right at this moment.

241
00:15:28,738 --> 00:15:30,773
This way of thinking
has given us powers

242
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:34,443
that al-Hazen himself
would have regarded as wizardry.

243
00:15:37,947 --> 00:15:42,317
But it was he who put us
on this rough, endless road.

244
00:15:44,187 --> 00:15:47,055
And now it has taken us
to a place

245
00:15:47,090 --> 00:15:51,794
where even light itself
is enshrouded in darkness.

246
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:02,229
Light has properties unlike
anything else

247
00:16:02,263 --> 00:16:04,131
in the realm
of human existence.

248
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:06,300
Take the speed of light.

249
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,435
The basic particle of light,
the photon,

250
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:11,138
is born traveling
<i>at</i> the speed of light

251
00:16:11,172 --> 00:16:13,941
as it emerges from
an atom or a molecule.

252
00:16:13,975 --> 00:16:16,109
A photon never knows
any other speed,

253
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:18,946
and we've not found another
phenomenon that accelerates

254
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,915
from zero to top speed
instantaneously.

255
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:24,151
Nothing else
could move as fast.

256
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:26,820
When we try to accelerate other
particles closer and closer

257
00:16:26,854 --> 00:16:29,556
to the speed of light,
they resist more and more,

258
00:16:29,591 --> 00:16:31,325
as though they're getting
heavier and heavier.

259
00:16:31,359 --> 00:16:32,793
No experiment yet devised

260
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:36,830
has ever made a particle
move as fast as light.

261
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,139
What was that?

262
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:48,342
You hear something?

263
00:16:48,376 --> 00:16:50,510
Where was I? Oh, yeah.

264
00:16:50,545 --> 00:16:54,615
I don't know anything else
in life that behaves like light.

265
00:16:54,649 --> 00:16:58,085
I cannot reconcile
its strange properties

266
00:16:58,119 --> 00:17:00,754
with everything else
my senses tell me.

267
00:17:00,788 --> 00:17:03,757
Our urge to trust
our senses overpowers

268
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,859
what our measuring devices
tell us about

269
00:17:05,894 --> 00:17:07,794
the actual nature of reality.

270
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,997
Our senses work fine
for life-size objects

271
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:11,832
moving at mammal speeds,

272
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:16,470
but are ill-adapted for the
wonderland laws of lightspeed.

273
00:17:20,642 --> 00:17:24,011
We don't even know why
there's a cosmic speed limit.

274
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:27,481
Time stands still when you're
traveling at the speed of light.

275
00:17:27,515 --> 00:17:29,983
What<i> is</i> light, anyway?

276
00:17:33,521 --> 00:17:37,024
<i>Isaac Newton's enduring</i>
<i>fascination with light</i>

277
00:17:37,058 --> 00:17:39,226
<i>began when he was a child...</i>

278
00:17:41,663 --> 00:17:44,097
<i>in this very house.</i>

279
00:17:49,170 --> 00:17:53,340
By the time he was in his 20s,
Newton became the first person

280
00:17:53,374 --> 00:17:56,543
to decipher the mystery
of the rainbow.

281
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:03,550
<i>Newton discovered that some</i>
<i>light, or white light,</i>

282
00:18:03,585 --> 00:18:06,553
<i>is a mixture of all the colors</i>
<i>of the rainbow.</i>

283
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:11,158
<i>Major discovery.</i>

284
00:18:11,192 --> 00:18:13,727
<i>He named the displays of colors</i>
<i>a "spectrum"</i>

285
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:18,031
<i>from the Latin for "phantom"</i>
<i>or "apparition."</i>

286
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:32,246
Begging your pardon,
Master Newton,

287
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:34,982
the cook frets that your dinner
will spoil, sir.

288
00:18:37,886 --> 00:18:40,053
<i>No, Isaac, don't</i>
<i>put the magnifying glass down!</i>

289
00:18:40,088 --> 00:18:43,857
<i>Something even more amazing</i>
<i>is hidden in the light--</i>

290
00:18:43,892 --> 00:18:46,393
<i>a code, a key to the cosmos.</i>

291
00:18:53,167 --> 00:18:57,070
Isaac Newton didn't miss much,
but that one was a beaut.

292
00:18:57,105 --> 00:19:00,207
He just walked right past
the door to a hidden universe;

293
00:19:00,241 --> 00:19:04,278
a door that would not swing open
again for another 150 years.

294
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:06,613
It would fall
on another scientist,

295
00:19:06,648 --> 00:19:08,315
working in the year 1800,

296
00:19:08,349 --> 00:19:10,317
to stumble
on a piece of evidence

297
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:13,353
for the unseen worlds
that surround us.

298
00:19:16,925 --> 00:19:19,358
By night, William Herschel
scanned the heavens

299
00:19:19,392 --> 00:19:21,861
with the largest telescope
of his time.

300
00:19:21,895 --> 00:19:24,831
By day, Herschel performed
experiments.

301
00:19:24,865 --> 00:19:27,500
From Newton's earlier work,
it was known that sunlight

302
00:19:27,534 --> 00:19:29,902
is a blend of different colors.

303
00:19:29,937 --> 00:19:32,304
And everyone knew,
just from being outside,

304
00:19:32,339 --> 00:19:34,539
that sunlight carries heat.

305
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,076
<i>William Herschel asked</i>

306
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:40,679
<i>whether some colors of light</i>
<i>carry more heat than others.</i>

307
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:44,816
<i>The nature of scientific genius</i>
<i>is to question</i>

308
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:47,652
<i>what the rest of us</i>
<i>take for granted...</i>

309
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:50,253
<i>and then do the experiment.</i>

310
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:55,726
<i>The thermometer that Herschel</i>
<i>placed outside the spectrum</i>

311
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,761
<i>was his control.</i>

312
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,365
<i>The control in any experiment</i>

313
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:04,034
<i>always lacks</i>
<i>the factor being tested.</i>

314
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:06,168
That way, you know
<i>if what you're testing is</i>

315
00:20:06,203 --> 00:20:08,304
<i>really the thing responsible</i>
<i>for the observation.</i>

316
00:20:09,439 --> 00:20:10,740
<i>In Herschel's experiment,</i>

317
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:12,375
<i>the relationship between</i>

318
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:13,776
<i>color and temperature</i>
<i>was being tested,</i>

319
00:20:13,811 --> 00:20:16,880
<i>and so his control was</i>
<i>a thermometer</i>

320
00:20:16,914 --> 00:20:18,581
<i>over the part</i>
<i>of the white sheet</i>

321
00:20:18,616 --> 00:20:21,917
<i>that was not illuminated</i>
<i>by sunlight at all.</i>

322
00:20:24,253 --> 00:20:25,787
<i>There's that sound again.</i>

323
00:20:25,822 --> 00:20:28,557
<i>What is that?</i>

324
00:20:34,296 --> 00:20:36,798
<i>Okay, red light is warmer</i>
<i>than blue light.</i>

325
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:41,903
<i>Interesting discovery,</i>
<i>but not exactly revolutionary.</i>

326
00:21:03,424 --> 00:21:07,126
<i>No, there's nothing wrong</i>
<i>with your thermometer.</i>

327
00:21:07,161 --> 00:21:10,529
<i>You've just discovered</i>
<i>a new kind of light.</i>

328
00:21:19,372 --> 00:21:22,441
Herschel was the first
to detect this unseen presence

329
00:21:22,475 --> 00:21:25,677
lurking just below
the red end of the spectrum.

330
00:21:25,711 --> 00:21:28,613
That's why it came
to be called "infrared."

331
00:21:28,647 --> 00:21:30,815
"Infra" is Latin
for the word "below."

332
00:21:30,849 --> 00:21:32,416
It's invisible.

333
00:21:32,451 --> 00:21:34,819
Our eyes are not sensitive
to this kind of light,

334
00:21:34,853 --> 00:21:37,722
but our skin is--
we feel it as heat.

335
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:39,557
Now, that's
a really big discovery.

336
00:21:39,592 --> 00:21:41,992
But far greater secrets
were still hiding

337
00:21:42,026 --> 00:21:44,494
deep inside the light.

338
00:21:50,384 --> 00:21:52,418
<i>At about the
same time that William Herschel</i>

339
00:21:52,452 --> 00:21:55,353
<i>was discovering infrared light</i>
<i>in his parlor in England,</i>

340
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:57,856
<i>a young boy named</i>
<i>Joseph Fraunhofer</i>

341
00:21:57,891 --> 00:22:00,358
<i>was trapped</i>
<i>in hopeless drudgery.</i>

342
00:22:00,393 --> 00:22:03,328
<i>He stood over a cauldron</i>
<i>of toxic chemicals</i>

343
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:05,731
<i>and endlessly stirred.</i>

344
00:22:07,633 --> 00:22:10,435
<i>Joseph had been orphaned</i>
<i>at the age of 11</i>

345
00:22:10,469 --> 00:22:14,271
<i>and given to a harsh master</i>
<i>named Weichselberger,</i>

346
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:17,241
<i>the royal mirror-maker.</i>

347
00:22:17,275 --> 00:22:19,543
<i>He prevented Joseph</i>
<i>from going to school.</i>

348
00:22:19,578 --> 00:22:22,780
<i>Instead, Joseph labored in</i>

349
00:22:22,815 --> 00:22:24,749
<i>the glass-making</i>
<i>workshop by day,</i>

350
00:22:24,783 --> 00:22:27,250
<i>and tended to the master's</i>
<i>household chores by night.</i>

351
00:22:32,757 --> 00:22:34,257
Hurry up, stupid!

352
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:37,227
And remember, no reading.

353
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:44,433
<i>Until Joseph got his big break.</i>

354
00:22:44,467 --> 00:22:48,560
<i>Weichselberger's</i>
<i>house collapsed.</i>

355
00:23:06,619 --> 00:23:08,487
<i>Maximilian, the future</i>
<i>king of Bavaria,</i>

356
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:10,422
<i>hurried to the scene</i>
<i>of the calamity</i>

357
00:23:10,456 --> 00:23:11,990
<i>to see if he could help.</i>

358
00:23:12,025 --> 00:23:14,459
<i>Maximilian was known for</i>

359
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:16,094
<i>taking an interest</i>
<i>in his subjects,</i>

360
00:23:16,129 --> 00:23:18,330
<i>which was highly unusual</i>
<i>for its time.</i>

361
00:23:32,212 --> 00:23:35,347
<i>In attracting the concern</i>
<i>of the future king of Bavaria,</i>

362
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,982
<i>young Joseph Fraunhofer</i>

363
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:39,818
<i>found an aperture into</i>
<i>a different universe.</i>

364
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:42,287
<i>And not just for himself.</i>

365
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,859
<i>Prince Maximilian</i>
<i>gave Joseph money</i>

366
00:23:46,893 --> 00:23:48,694
<i>and asked his privy councilor</i>

367
00:23:48,728 --> 00:23:50,162
<i>to provide further</i>
<i>help to the boy,</i>

368
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,564
<i>should it be needed.</i>

369
00:23:57,437 --> 00:24:00,139
<i>Weichselberger continued</i>
<i>to exploit him</i>

370
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:02,474
<i>and prevent him</i>
<i>from attending school.</i>

371
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:04,543
<i>But the prince's councilor</i>
<i>intervened,</i>

372
00:24:04,577 --> 00:24:08,080
<i>offering Joseph a position</i>
<i>at the Optical Institute.</i>

373
00:24:08,114 --> 00:24:13,252
<i>This small gesture of kindness</i>
<i>really paid off.</i>

374
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:28,434
By the time he was 27,

375
00:24:28,468 --> 00:24:30,703
Joseph Fraunhofer was
the world's leading designer

376
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:32,738
of high-quality lenses,

377
00:24:32,772 --> 00:24:35,441
telescopes and other
optical instruments.

378
00:24:35,475 --> 00:24:39,345
His firm was housed here,
in the old Benediktbeuren Abbey.

379
00:24:39,379 --> 00:24:41,547
In the early 19th century,

380
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:44,883
this was top-secret,
ultra-high technology.

381
00:24:47,921 --> 00:24:50,122
The Benedictine monks
of earlier times

382
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:52,124
had taken a vow of secrecy.

383
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:54,126
This local tradition,

384
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,627
and the ability
to restrict access

385
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:57,196
to Fraunhofer's laboratory,

386
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:59,198
allowed him to maintain control

387
00:24:59,232 --> 00:25:02,301
of trade and state secrets.

388
00:25:07,407 --> 00:25:09,708
<i>Fraunhofer was experimenting</i>
<i>with prisms</i>

389
00:25:09,743 --> 00:25:13,145
<i>to find the best types of glass</i>
<i>for precision lenses.</i>

390
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:15,881
<i>How, he wondered,</i>
<i>could he get a better look</i>

391
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,916
<i>at the spectrum that</i>
<i>a prism produced?</i>

392
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:24,890
Friedrich, bring me
the theodolite, please.

393
00:25:24,924 --> 00:25:27,826
Okay, while Fraunhofer
sets up his theodolite--

394
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,662
it's a kind of telescope--

395
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,998
I want to show you something
in another part of the abbey.

396
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:41,373
<i>Sound waves are</i>
<i>so beautiful to hear.</i>

397
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:47,913
<i>Imagine how beautiful</i>
<i>they'd be to see.</i>

398
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:51,150
You ever wondered why organ
pipes have different lengths?

399
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:54,620
I press a key...

400
00:25:57,123 --> 00:25:58,524
it sends compressed air

401
00:25:58,558 --> 00:25:59,792
into a particular pipe,

402
00:25:59,826 --> 00:26:01,627
producing sound waves.

403
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:04,363
If we could slow the sound waves
down a few hundred times,

404
00:26:04,397 --> 00:26:06,532
they would look like this.

405
00:26:10,236 --> 00:26:11,870
The length of the pipe

406
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:13,339
determines the length
of the sound wave

407
00:26:13,373 --> 00:26:14,840
that can fit inside it.

408
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,942
A short pipe gives you
a short sound wave.

409
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,714
Short sounds waves have
high pitch, or frequency.

410
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,888
Let's stop the waves
for a better look.

411
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:36,195
The distance between
adjacent waves

412
00:26:36,229 --> 00:26:37,997
is called the wavelength.

413
00:26:38,031 --> 00:26:40,532
A long pipe gives you
a long sound wave

414
00:26:40,567 --> 00:26:42,935
with a low pitch,
or low frequency.

415
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:37,389
The medieval manuscript of
this music, "Carmina Burana,"

416
00:27:37,424 --> 00:27:40,592
was discovered
in this very abbey.

417
00:27:43,797 --> 00:27:46,231
Sound waves can't travel
through a vacuum.

418
00:27:46,266 --> 00:27:48,133
They need matter to ride on,

419
00:27:48,168 --> 00:27:51,637
like molecules of air,
or water, or rock.

420
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,772
But light waves fly solo.

421
00:27:53,807 --> 00:27:55,975
They can move
through empty space.

422
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,609
And fast--

423
00:27:57,644 --> 00:28:00,746
a million times faster
than sound waves in air.

424
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,748
And the wavelengths
of the light we see

425
00:28:02,782 --> 00:28:05,284
are so much shorter
than sound waves.

426
00:28:05,318 --> 00:28:08,153
About 50,000 light waves

427
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:10,622
would fit right in here.

428
00:28:11,791 --> 00:28:13,325
Oh, yeah.

429
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,793
Fraunhofer.

430
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:22,768
Just in time.

431
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:24,436
We didn't miss it.

432
00:28:24,471 --> 00:28:26,638
<i>Just as the wavelength of sound</i>

433
00:28:26,673 --> 00:28:28,640
<i>determines the pitch</i>
<i>that we hear,</i>

434
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:30,142
<i>the wavelength of light</i>

435
00:28:30,176 --> 00:28:32,611
<i>determines the color</i>
<i>that we see.</i>

436
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:35,080
<i>But how does a prism</i>
<i>spread out the colors</i>

437
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,616
<i>concealed in</i>
<i>a beam of sunlight?</i>

438
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:41,587
<i>When light travels</i>
<i>through air or space,</i>

439
00:28:41,621 --> 00:28:43,989
<i>all its colors move</i>
<i>at the same speed.</i>

440
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:48,794
<i>But when it hits glass</i>
<i>at an angle,</i>

441
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:51,230
<i>the light slows down</i>
<i>and changes direction.</i>

442
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,767
<i>Inside the prism,</i>

443
00:28:54,801 --> 00:28:56,802
<i>each color moves</i>
<i>at a different speed.</i>

444
00:29:01,141 --> 00:29:02,941
<i>In glass, violet light,</i>

445
00:29:02,976 --> 00:29:05,144
<i>which is carried by</i>
<i>the shortest waves we see,</i>

446
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:07,179
<i>slows down more than red light,</i>

447
00:29:07,213 --> 00:29:09,648
<i>which has the longest waves.</i>

448
00:29:11,484 --> 00:29:13,886
<i>These changes in speed</i>

449
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,455
<i>pry the colors apart,</i>

450
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:18,290
<i>sending their waves off</i>

451
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:20,726
<i>in slightly different</i>
<i>directions.</i>

452
00:29:21,928 --> 00:29:23,929
That's how a prism works.

453
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:28,333
If I seem unduly
emotional about this,

454
00:29:28,368 --> 00:29:31,170
it's because Joseph Fraunhofer
is about to do

455
00:29:31,204 --> 00:29:34,707
what Isaac Newton
could've done, but didn't.

456
00:29:34,741 --> 00:29:36,809
And it'll have a powerful effect

457
00:29:36,843 --> 00:29:38,677
on the course of my own life.

458
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:03,736
<i>You are witnessing the marriage</i>

459
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,371
<i>of physics and astronomy,</i>

460
00:30:05,405 --> 00:30:09,274
<i>the birth of my own</i>
<i>field of science,</i>

461
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:11,744
<i>astrophysics.</i>

462
00:30:13,747 --> 00:30:15,514
Written in the light,

463
00:30:15,548 --> 00:30:18,951
in those vertical black lines...

464
00:30:20,387 --> 00:30:23,355
is secret code.

465
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:26,191
<i>Fraunhofer looked at them,</i>
<i>and wondered...</i>

466
00:30:26,226 --> 00:30:28,227
Why?

467
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:33,465
<i>A code that comes to us</i>

468
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,934
<i>from an alien universe.</i>

469
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:47,546
<i>What is the message</i>

470
00:30:47,632 --> 00:30:51,236
<i>written in these dark,</i>
<i>vertical lines?</i>

471
00:30:56,309 --> 00:30:58,376
It took a hundred years
of thinking,

472
00:30:58,411 --> 00:31:01,713
questioning, searching
to decipher it.

473
00:31:21,267 --> 00:31:23,401
Lovely, isn't it?

474
00:31:23,436 --> 00:31:24,970
Why?

475
00:31:25,004 --> 00:31:28,473
There are many layers to
the fine structure of beauty...

476
00:31:28,508 --> 00:31:31,643
<i>the chemistry of the Earth</i>
<i>and its atmosphere...</i>

477
00:31:31,677 --> 00:31:34,613
<i>the evolution of life...</i>

478
00:31:34,647 --> 00:31:38,216
<i>Many distinct threads.</i>

479
00:31:38,251 --> 00:31:41,319
Let's just examine one,
at the surface...

480
00:31:41,354 --> 00:31:43,755
the colors of nature
that dazzle us.

481
00:31:43,789 --> 00:31:46,892
<i>What's really happening?</i>

482
00:31:46,926 --> 00:31:48,793
<i>How does the red, the blue...</i>

483
00:31:48,828 --> 00:31:51,796
<i>the astonishing palette</i>
<i>of nature's colors...</i>

484
00:31:55,801 --> 00:31:58,436
how do they happen?

485
00:32:01,107 --> 00:32:03,275
Light waves of different lengths
from the Sun

486
00:32:03,309 --> 00:32:04,709
strike the Earth.

487
00:32:06,112 --> 00:32:08,146
The petals of these
particular flowers

488
00:32:08,181 --> 00:32:09,748
absorb all the low-energy,

489
00:32:09,782 --> 00:32:12,017
long red wavelengths of light.

490
00:32:12,051 --> 00:32:13,752
But the petals reflect

491
00:32:13,786 --> 00:32:17,088
the shorter, high-energy
blue wavelengths.

492
00:32:17,123 --> 00:32:19,858
That interaction
between starlight and petal--

493
00:32:19,892 --> 00:32:21,860
or water, or Van Gogh--

494
00:32:21,894 --> 00:32:23,461
is what makes blue.

495
00:32:23,496 --> 00:32:25,630
The longest waves,

496
00:32:25,665 --> 00:32:27,465
the ones we see as red,

497
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,068
have the lowest energy.

498
00:32:33,005 --> 00:32:35,340
Color is the way
our eyes perceive

499
00:32:35,374 --> 00:32:37,242
how energetic light waves are.

500
00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:40,779
<i>A sunset...</i>

501
00:32:40,813 --> 00:32:42,948
<i>a flag...</i>

502
00:32:42,982 --> 00:32:45,383
<i>the eyes of your beloved...</i>

503
00:32:45,418 --> 00:32:47,152
<i>that shiny new car.</i>

504
00:32:47,186 --> 00:32:49,154
The feelings they inspire

505
00:32:49,188 --> 00:32:50,989
happen when something inside you

506
00:32:51,023 --> 00:32:53,492
is triggered by
a particular variation

507
00:32:53,526 --> 00:32:56,995
in the frequency and
energy of light waves.

508
00:32:58,764 --> 00:32:59,898
<i>And the secret message?</i>

509
00:32:59,932 --> 00:33:01,633
<i>Those black vertical lines</i>

510
00:33:01,667 --> 00:33:03,668
<i>in Fraunhofer's spectrum?</i>

511
00:33:03,703 --> 00:33:05,804
<i>What makes them?</i>

512
00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:08,006
<i>They occur when the light waves</i>

513
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,809
<i>of those particular colors</i>
<i>are being absorbed.</i>

514
00:33:10,843 --> 00:33:13,378
<i>It happens on another level</i>
<i>of reality,</i>

515
00:33:13,412 --> 00:33:16,414
<i>far smaller than the world</i>
<i>we're used to operating in.</i>

516
00:33:16,449 --> 00:33:19,017
<i>To get there,</i>
<i>we'll need to become</i>

517
00:33:19,051 --> 00:33:21,786
<i>ten billion times smaller</i>
<i>than we are.</i>

518
00:33:24,557 --> 00:33:26,925
<i>We could pick</i>
<i>any one of these atoms.</i>

519
00:33:26,959 --> 00:33:30,028
<i>But let's go</i>
<i>for the hydrogen atom.</i>

520
00:33:30,062 --> 00:33:32,531
The hydrogen atom is
the most plentiful kind

521
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:34,933
of atom in the cosmos.

522
00:33:34,967 --> 00:33:37,369
And the simplest.

523
00:33:44,877 --> 00:33:48,046
<i>It has only one electron.</i>

524
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,582
<i>And only one proton.</i>

525
00:33:50,616 --> 00:33:52,684
<i>We've entered</i>
<i>the quantum realm.</i>

526
00:33:52,718 --> 00:33:54,519
<i>It doesn't correspond</i>

527
00:33:54,554 --> 00:33:57,289
<i>to ordinary human experience.</i>

528
00:33:57,323 --> 00:34:00,525
<i>Common sense is</i>
<i>no help here at all.</i>

529
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:03,562
<i>Take the hydrogen atom's</i>
<i>electron, for example.</i>

530
00:34:05,498 --> 00:34:07,732
<i>In an atom, an electron</i>

531
00:34:07,767 --> 00:34:09,467
<i>doesn't exist between orbitals.</i>

532
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:11,269
<i>It disappears from one orbital</i>

533
00:34:11,304 --> 00:34:13,939
<i>and reappears in another.</i>

534
00:34:13,973 --> 00:34:15,774
<i>It's as if you took an elevator</i>
<i>from the second floor</i>

535
00:34:15,808 --> 00:34:19,077
<i>to the fourth floor,</i>
<i>but ceased to exist in between.</i>

536
00:34:19,111 --> 00:34:20,812
<i>And another thing.</i>

537
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:23,782
<i>Quantum elevators only stop</i>
<i>at certain floors.</i>

538
00:34:23,816 --> 00:34:27,219
<i>The sizes of the electron</i>
<i>orbits are strictly limited,</i>

539
00:34:27,253 --> 00:34:30,088
<i>and different</i>
<i>for the atoms of every element.</i>

540
00:34:31,624 --> 00:34:33,959
<i>That's why the elements</i>
<i>are different.</i>

541
00:34:33,993 --> 00:34:35,327
<i>The chemistry</i>
<i>of anything is determined</i>

542
00:34:35,361 --> 00:34:36,928
<i>by its electron orbits.</i>

543
00:34:36,963 --> 00:34:39,831
<i>The force that holds</i>
<i>an electron in orbit</i>

544
00:34:39,866 --> 00:34:41,666
<i>has nothing to do with gravity.</i>

545
00:34:41,701 --> 00:34:45,237
<i>It's a force</i>
<i>of electrical attraction.</i>

546
00:34:45,271 --> 00:34:47,572
<i>The electron dances a wavy ring</i>

547
00:34:47,607 --> 00:34:49,841
<i>around the central nucleus</i>
<i>of a hydrogen atom.</i>

548
00:34:49,876 --> 00:34:52,644
<i>And makes quantum leaps</i>
<i>from orbit to orbit.</i>

549
00:34:52,678 --> 00:34:53,945
<i>Up or down.</i>

550
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,347
<i>The larger the orbit,</i>

551
00:34:55,381 --> 00:34:57,415
<i>the greater the energy</i>
<i>of an electron.</i>

552
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:59,818
<i>An electron has</i>

553
00:34:59,852 --> 00:35:01,987
<i>to get energy to leap</i>
<i>to a larger orbit.</i>

554
00:35:02,021 --> 00:35:04,823
<i>And it has to lose energy</i>
<i>to jump back down.</i>

555
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:08,159
<i>Every upward leap</i>
<i>is caused by...</i>

556
00:35:08,194 --> 00:35:11,596
<i>an atom absorbing a light wave.</i>

557
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:15,433
<i>But we have no idea what causes</i>
<i>the downward leaps.</i>

558
00:35:15,468 --> 00:35:19,037
<i>What we do know that such leaps</i>
<i>always produce a light wave</i>

559
00:35:19,071 --> 00:35:21,706
<i>whose color matches</i>
<i>the energy difference</i>

560
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:23,508
<i>between the orbitals.</i>

561
00:35:28,414 --> 00:35:32,817
<i>The Sun's surface radiates</i>
<i>light waves of all colors.</i>

562
00:35:32,852 --> 00:35:34,653
<i>If you look at sunlight</i>
<i>through a prism,</i>

563
00:35:34,687 --> 00:35:36,688
<i>you'll see its spectrum.</i>

564
00:35:39,325 --> 00:35:42,160
<i>When you magnify the spectrum</i>
<i>with a telescope,</i>

565
00:35:42,195 --> 00:35:44,062
<i>as Joseph Fraunhofer did,</i>

566
00:35:44,096 --> 00:35:45,664
<i>you raise the curtain</i>

567
00:35:45,698 --> 00:35:48,900
<i>on the electron dance</i>
<i>within the atom.</i>

568
00:35:48,935 --> 00:35:51,136
<i>When the energy</i>
<i>of the electron flags,</i>

569
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:52,837
<i>and it drops</i>
<i>to a lower orbital,</i>

570
00:35:52,872 --> 00:35:55,240
<i>the light wave</i>
<i>it emits scatters.</i>

571
00:35:55,274 --> 00:35:57,676
<i>Most of it doesn't reach us.</i>

572
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:59,244
<i>That leaves a dark gap</i>

573
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:02,180
<i>or black vertical line</i>
<i>in the spectrum.</i>

574
00:36:02,215 --> 00:36:04,749
<i>These dark lines</i>
<i>are the shadows</i>

575
00:36:04,784 --> 00:36:06,384
<i>cast by hydrogen atoms</i>

576
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:08,353
<i>in the atmosphere of the Sun.</i>

577
00:36:08,387 --> 00:36:11,089
<i>Sodium atoms cast</i>
<i>different shadows.</i>

578
00:36:11,123 --> 00:36:14,192
<i>Their electrons dance</i>
<i>to a different tune.</i>

579
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:16,094
<i>A grain of table salt</i>
<i>is composed</i>

580
00:36:16,128 --> 00:36:17,929
<i>of sodium and chlorine atoms.</i>

581
00:36:17,964 --> 00:36:20,398
<i>Ten million billion of them</i>

582
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:22,400
<i>doing their crazy dances</i>

583
00:36:22,435 --> 00:36:25,270
<i>in a single grain of salt.</i>

584
00:36:25,304 --> 00:36:28,206
<i>And a single iron atom</i>
<i>with 26 electrons</i>

585
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:30,575
<i>is like a great</i>
<i>big production number</i>

586
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:33,912
<i>in a Broadway musical.</i>

587
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:40,218
<i>When you look at a star</i>
<i>with a spectroscope,</i>

588
00:36:40,253 --> 00:36:42,687
<i>you see the dark lines</i>
<i>from all the elements</i>

589
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:44,356
<i>in its atmosphere.</i>

590
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:46,258
<i>Show me the spectrum</i>
<i>of anything,</i>

591
00:36:46,292 --> 00:36:49,060
<i>whether here on Earth</i>
<i>or from a distant star,</i>

592
00:36:49,095 --> 00:36:52,130
<i>and I'll tell you</i>
<i>what it's made of.</i>

593
00:36:52,164 --> 00:36:55,767
Fraunhofer's lines are
the atomic signatures

594
00:36:55,801 --> 00:36:59,771
of the elements writ large
across the cosmos.

595
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:01,873
As with every
other major revelation

596
00:37:01,908 --> 00:37:04,409
in the history of science,
it opened the way

597
00:37:04,443 --> 00:37:07,412
to newer and deeper mysteries.

598
00:37:07,446 --> 00:37:10,415
And to the revelation
that there were

599
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:13,485
many more secrets
hiding in the light.

600
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:24,369
When Joseph Fraunhofer combined
a prism with a telescope

601
00:37:24,371 --> 00:37:26,638
and turned it toward the skies,

602
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:30,141
he brought the stars
much closer to us.

603
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:43,855
<i>When he was only 39,</i>

604
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:46,024
<i>he contracted a fatal illness.</i>

605
00:37:46,026 --> 00:37:48,693
<i>Perhaps as a result of his</i>
<i>early and long-term exposure</i>

606
00:37:48,695 --> 00:37:51,629
<i>to the toxic chemicals</i>
<i>of glassmaking.</i>

607
00:37:51,631 --> 00:37:55,633
<i>You never know where</i>
<i>the next genius will come from.</i>

608
00:37:59,572 --> 00:38:04,075
<i>How many of them do we leave</i>
<i>in the rubble?</i>

609
00:38:04,077 --> 00:38:07,345
<i>The prince and his kingdom</i>
<i>were immeasurably enriched</i>

610
00:38:07,347 --> 00:38:10,715
<i>by that act of kindness</i>
<i>to a poor orphan.</i>

611
00:38:10,717 --> 00:38:13,151
<i>Fraunhofer's discoveries</i>
<i>transformed Bavaria</i>

612
00:38:13,153 --> 00:38:17,422
<i>from a rural backwater</i>
<i>to a technological powerhouse.</i>

613
00:38:19,258 --> 00:38:21,693
<i>As he lay dying,</i>
<i>the government was desperate</i>

614
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:24,596
<i>to preserve every shred</i>
<i>of his precious knowledge</i>

615
00:38:24,598 --> 00:38:26,898
<i>about the high technology</i>
<i>of optical glass.</i>

616
00:38:29,935 --> 00:38:31,870
<i>But it could only be divulged</i>
<i>to a person</i>

617
00:38:31,872 --> 00:38:34,072
<i>with top security clearance--</i>

618
00:38:34,074 --> 00:38:35,840
<i>the director of the mint.</i>

619
00:38:52,925 --> 00:38:55,526
<i>The government kept</i>
<i>Fraunhofer's technology</i>

620
00:38:55,528 --> 00:38:57,428
<i>for making perfect</i>
<i>optical glass</i>

621
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,698
<i>a State secret</i>
<i>for another hundred years.</i>

622
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:02,700
This would prove
to be a major obstacle

623
00:39:02,735 --> 00:39:05,203
for someone we'll meet later
in our journey.

624
00:39:05,237 --> 00:39:07,772
But Fraunhofer would allow
no such secrecy

625
00:39:07,806 --> 00:39:10,375
where his pure scientific
research was concerned.

626
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:14,012
He knew that science requires
openness to flourish;

627
00:39:14,046 --> 00:39:18,082
that our understanding of nature
belongs to the world.

628
00:39:18,117 --> 00:39:21,019
As soon as Fraunhofer discovered
the spectral lines,

629
00:39:21,053 --> 00:39:23,588
he published everything
he knew about them.

630
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:26,424
And the reverberations
of his momentous discovery

631
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:29,227
echo still.

632
00:39:32,398 --> 00:39:36,367
<i>His spectral lines revealed</i>
<i>that the visible cosmos</i>

633
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:39,671
<i>is all made</i>
<i>of the same elements.</i>

634
00:39:42,708 --> 00:39:45,176
<i>The planets...</i>

635
00:39:53,318 --> 00:39:55,787
<i>The stars...</i>

636
00:40:00,159 --> 00:40:02,293
<i>The galaxies...</i>

637
00:40:06,532 --> 00:40:09,534
<i>We, ourselves,</i>
<i>and all of life...</i>

638
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:19,744
<i>The same star stuff.</i>

639
00:40:25,184 --> 00:40:26,851
<i>He made it possible</i>
<i>for us to know</i>

640
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:29,353
<i>what's in the atmosphere</i>
<i>of other worlds.</i>

641
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:35,460
<i>And in galaxies millions</i>
<i>of light-years away.</i>

642
00:40:35,494 --> 00:40:37,495
<i>Spectral lines revealed</i>
<i>not only the composition</i>

643
00:40:37,529 --> 00:40:39,997
<i>of far-off objects,</i>
<i>but also their motion</i>

644
00:40:40,032 --> 00:40:42,200
<i>towards or away from us.</i>

645
00:40:42,234 --> 00:40:45,303
<i>Using them, we discovered</i>
<i>that our universe is expanding.</i>

646
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:48,906
<i>But perhaps the greatest</i>
<i>revelation of spectroscopy</i>

647
00:40:48,941 --> 00:40:51,742
<i>is the discovery</i>
<i>of the thing it cannot see.</i>

648
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,917
<i>A hidden universe</i>
<i>of dark matter</i>

649
00:40:59,952 --> 00:41:03,187
<i>six times more massive</i>
<i>than the familiar cosmos.</i>

650
00:41:03,222 --> 00:41:05,389
<i>It's made</i>
<i>of some mysterious substance</i>

651
00:41:05,424 --> 00:41:09,994
<i>that does not emit, reflect</i>
<i>or absorb any kind of light.</i>

652
00:41:10,028 --> 00:41:12,497
<i>We only know it's there</i>
<i>because of its gravity,</i>

653
00:41:12,531 --> 00:41:14,599
<i>which pulls on all the galaxies</i>

654
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:17,368
<i>and speeds up</i>
<i>the visible stars within them.</i>

655
00:41:21,373 --> 00:41:24,842
There are many more kinds of
light than our eyes can see.

656
00:41:24,877 --> 00:41:28,279
Confining our perception
of nature to visible light

657
00:41:28,313 --> 00:41:30,615
is like listening to music

658
00:41:30,649 --> 00:41:32,216
in only one octave.

659
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:36,788
There are so many more.

660
00:41:36,822 --> 00:41:38,756
They differ only in wavelength,

661
00:41:38,791 --> 00:41:40,892
but over a huge range.

662
00:41:40,926 --> 00:41:43,494
For instance, infrared light...

663
00:41:48,834 --> 00:41:51,969
<i>the kind that</i>
<i>William Herschel discovered</i>

664
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:53,771
<i>Or X-ray light.</i>

665
00:41:58,844 --> 00:42:00,912
<i>Or radio light.</i>

666
00:42:05,651 --> 00:42:07,485
<i>Or in gamma-ray light.</i>

667
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:16,561
<i>These are not just different</i>
<i>ways of seeing the same thing.</i>

668
00:42:16,595 --> 00:42:18,162
<i>These other kinds of light</i>

669
00:42:18,197 --> 00:42:21,799
reveal different objects
and phenomena in the cosmos.

670
00:42:21,834 --> 00:42:25,002
In gamma-ray light, for example,
we can see mysterious explosions

671
00:42:25,037 --> 00:42:26,771
<i>in distant galaxies</i>

672
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:29,106
<i>that we would otherwise miss.</i>

673
00:42:32,044 --> 00:42:34,912
<i>And in microwave light,</i>
<i>we can see all the way back</i>

674
00:42:34,947 --> 00:42:37,348
<i>to the birth of the universe.</i>

675
00:42:39,885 --> 00:42:43,187
We have only
just opened our eyes.
